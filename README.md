# CoRecruit Project

## Description
This project leverages a vast dataset from [Jobtech](https://www.jobtechdev.se/en), containing all job postings from ArbetsfÃ¶rmedlingen, to train an AI aimed at improving recruiters' job listings. By using scientific articles on recruiting to create an initial dataset, the project refines a version of ChatGPT to specifically recommend enhancements to job descriptions. The application, hosted on streamlit.io, serves as a practical tool for recruiters to generate more effective job postings based on AI-driven suggestions, improving the recruitment process through advanced machine learning techniques.
