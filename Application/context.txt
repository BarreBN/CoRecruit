Abstract
Purpose – This article presents an exploratory, narrative review on job ads research. It aims to explore the key
features of job ads that have been investigated in previous researches; the way these features have been
investigated; and to draw important lessons that those studies teach us about the impact of job ad features on
the target population.
Design/methodology/approach – In this study, the scoping-review procedure is applied. Its systematic
procedure enables scholars to provide a broad overview of a topic, map the key concepts underpinning a
research area, clarify the conceptual boundaries of a topic, and also to incorporate a numerical summary and
qualitative thematic analysis. The review was conducted based on a systematic study of 243 peer-reviewed
articles and publications in the grey literature.
Findings – The findings show that seven job ad features seem to have important impacts on (potential)
applicants, which we illustrate as a know-how framework. Eight main theories are used, and a wide array of
research methods are applied. However, the study concludes that after more than four decades of research,
there is still a limited understanding about the concrete effects of job ad features.
Originality/value – This paper synthesizes the existing knowledge, answers three exploratory questions
regarding job ad features and draws theoretical and practical lessons from previous studies. In the interest of
conducting future studies and providing a research agenda, a typology of theoretical perspectives for the study
of job ads is also presented. The article also presents lessons for practitioners by providing a know-how
framework on the usage of job ads.

1. Introduction
As the quality of the workforce is important for organizational success, organizations spend
considerable efforts attracting and selecting suited applicants. To find and attract suited
applicants, the recruitment process plays an important role (Acikgoz, 2019; Ahmad and
Schroeder, 2002). Mistakes in the recruitment process may have destructive consequences for
organizations; seeking to correct those mistakes is not only a costly (Molander and Winterton,
1994, in: Blackman, 2006; Brencic and Norris, 2009; Burdett and Cunningham, 1998; Mathews
and Redman, 2001) and time-consuming activity (Snape et al., 1994), but it can also damage
firms’ growth and reputation (Sisodia and Chowdhary, 2012).
Job advertisements, sometimes labeled as “employment advertisements,” “job
announcements” or “job postings” – defined as “documents acknowledged through public

media for the company or the organization to find the right talents to fill in vacant positions”
(Fu, 2012) – play an important role in the early stages of the recruitment process (Barber, 1998;
Collins and Stevens, 2002; Schmidt et al., 2015; Williamson et al., 2008). Job ads are key bridges
between recruiters and job applicants (Mathews and Redman, 1998), and organizations hope
that potentially suited applicants will be motivated to apply based on reading them.
Therefore, it is not surprising that researchers have turned their attention to investigating
different elements of job ads. However, this field of study is still underdeveloped as the
literature is scattered across several disciplines, serious theoretical deficiencies are noticeable in
previous research, and there is also a lack of guiding principles for practitioners. There are also
a number of reports showing gaps, weaknesses and criticisms regarding our understanding in
the area of job ads. These gaps include a growing lack of clarity regarding the skills,
competencies and qualifications required for some professions (Anne Kennan et al., 2006), a
scarcity of studies on the impacts of individual differences on reactions to job advertisements
(Walkeret al., 2008), assigning a passive role to job seekers as “receivers” of information in the
related studies (Highouse and Hoffman, 2001), a lack of understanding of job seekers’reactions
to recruitment messages mostly by taking a microlevel approach (Reeve et al., 2006), a lack of
theoretical integration in recruitment research (Breaugh and Starke, 2000), a deficiency of
empirical research on job advertisements vis-a -vis studies on other recruitment practices (Jones
et al., 2006; Reeve and Schultz, 2004), and inconsistencies among researchers’ methodological
approaches (for selecting, collecting, analyzing, and presenting the data), which makes it
difficult to compare findings and draw definitive conclusions (Kim and Angnakoon, 2016).
Hence, given the status of the field, in this article, we review the literature using an
exploratory scoping method with an iterative coding procedure to synthesize the existing
knowledge to answer the following three exploratory questions: (1) What types of features of
job ads have been studied? (2) How have these features been investigated? (3) What do these
studies teach us about the impacts of these features on potential applicants?
The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we explain the
methodological details of our study. In Section 3, we provide descriptive results, in particular,
the research methodologies applied and the theories used in the reviewed studies; we also
discuss the distinctive features of job ads that have been found to have an important impact
on ad outcomes. In Section 4, we discuss the results. Finally, in Section 5, we present a research
agenda for future studies in which we advocate using the identified theories to obtain a better
understanding of the roles the identified elements play in attracting suited candidates.
2. Method
2.1 Literature search strategy
We followed the general procedure for scoping reviews as outlined by The Joanna Briggs
Institute (Peters et al., 2015). A scoping review is a rigorous and transparent method that
helps researchers provide a narrative account of the existing studies; examine the domain,
extent and nature of the studies; and disseminate a summarized report (Arksey and O’Malley,
2005). This method, with its systematic procedure, enables scholars to provide a broad
overview of a topic, map the key concepts underpinning a research area, clarify the
conceptual boundaries of a topic, and incorporate a numerical summary and qualitative
thematic analysis (Peters et al., 2015).
We decided to include (1) studies that were written in English (for reasons of
understanding) and (2) both published and unpublished articles and gray literature (such
as unpublished papers, working papers, reports, conference papers and book chapters) to
tackle potential publication bias. No limitations were set on the publication date. Considering
the aim of the study and to minimize bias by ensuring comprehensive coverage (Weed, 2008),
the search keywords and terms were selected by close reading of the relevant literature; these
IJOTB
terms were as follows: job, vacancy, position(s), recruitment, advertisement, ad(s), posting(s),
and announcement.
To identify potentially relevant studies, we started by searching the Web of Science
on February 16, 2018 using the following Boolean operator: (job near/0 ads) or (job
near/0 advertis*) or (job near/0 posting$) or (job near/0 description) or (vacancy near/
0 post*) or (vacancy near/0 announcement) or (recruitment near/0 ads) or (recruitment
near/0 advertis*) or (recruitment near/0 post*) or (recruitment near/0 announc*) or
(position near/0 ads) or (position near/0 advertis*). The application of these keywords
resulted in 1665 hits. Given the focus of our research on the organizational and
managerial literature, we decided next to limit our search to the following five
research domains: management, business, industrial labor relations, communication,
and public administration. This specification resulted in a list of 283 potentially
relevant articles. We replicated our literature search in Business Source Complete on
February 21, 2018 using the same Boolean operator. In this database, we found 648
hits. After removing 85 duplicates, we ended up with a preliminary sample of 846
articles.
Next, the first author screened these articles to determine eligibility. Only articles in
which job ads were analyzed either as primary topics or used as the primary source to
study a particular topic were included. After reading all abstracts, we kept 176 articles
in the sample. Seven articles were additionally removed after reading the full text of all
articles because they did not fit the earlier criteria. Finally, the second author validated
the selection made by the first author by assessing the eligibility of a random selection
of 170 articles (20%). The initial degree of discrepancy was 12%; after discussing these
discrepancies, in all cases, both authors agreed on the accuracy and correctness of
inclusion/exclusion decisions made by the first author. Therefore, 169 articles from
these two databases remained.
Because the Web of Science and Business Source Complete only include indexed
journals, in January 2019, we decided to conduct a complementary search on Google
Scholar and to send out an email to experts to discover relevant unpublished work,
nonpeer reviewed articles (in nonindexed journals), and studies published in the gray
literature. Specifically, on September 19, 2019, after conducting a search in Google
Scholar using the same keywords applied in the Web of Science and Business Source
Complete, we reviewed the first 15 pages of Google Scholar results, which led to 150
more complementary articles. After removing 21 duplicated articles and excluding 63
publications that did not meet our inclusion criteria, 66 articles remained and were
coded. Finally, the list of coded articles was sent to 20 experienced researchers in the
field asking them if they were aware of any important missing articles, which has
some implications covering our research main question. The experts were chosen
because they recently published research articles on features of job ads. Based on the
responses of 4 contacted experts, 8 more articles were found and coded. Figure 1
displays the flow of information through the different phases of the study process.
2.2 Coding scheme
For each article, we coded the following: (1) bibliographical information; (2)
methodological features, i.e., research method, level of analysis, sample, and sector;
(3) theoretical perspectives applied; and (4) the stated contribution, both theoretical
and practical. To fully explore the status of this field of study and what is known
about job ad features and their effects, we used a dual approach. That is, we not only
utilized all coded articles, but we also considered relevant cited material in the coded
articles.

3. Results
3.1 General characteristics of job ad-related studies
In total, 243 articles were systematically reviewed. Most of the coded articles (88%) were
published in peer-reviewed journals; however, 12% of them were nonreviewed and gray
literature materials. The selected articles were published between 1973 and 2019. Over time,
we found an increase in the number of articles studying job ads, especially since 2003. The
majority of the articles contained empirical research (97%). Most of the articles used
qualitative research methods (66%), mainly content analysis (62%). Quantitative methods
were contained in 30% of the articles, and the rest of the articles used mixed methods (4%).
Most of these articles justified the use of job ads as a data source by invoking the richness of
job ads as secondary data (e.g., Kuokkanen et al. (2013)) or even its importance in providing
primary data to study other organizational/managerial variables (e.g., Story et al. (2016)).
The distribution of articles by level of analysis, sector, and data source is presented in
Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, job ad studies focus on six different levels of analysis, of
which the “occupational” level, mostly seeking to analyze job ad content to discover
knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) related to specific professions, has received the most
attention (42%). Next, the “individual level” of analysis (23%) is used to diagnose the
perception/reaction of people encountering different types of job ads, and “multilevel”
scrutiny is also used (13%). Regarding sector and organizational context, data were collected
from employees or job ads in both nonprofit and for-profit sectors in 32% of the studies, in the
“for-profit” sector in 15% of the studies and in the “nonprofit” sector in 11% of the studies.
Nevertheless, a considerable portion of articles (42%) did not disclose the context and sector,
which poses some challenges for interpreting their results as sector-specific characteristics
have diverse and influential implications for multiple stakeholders.
Several sources of data were used to study job ads. Here,“online ads” constitute the largest
proportion (47%), and these data can better describe the importance of online job ads for
researchers. “Online ads” are followed by “people” (27%) (using questionnaires, observations
and/or interviews) and “printed ads”(12%). Finally, it is worth noting that most of the studies
were conducted in the US (38%), Australia (10%), and the UK (9%), showing the dominance of

job ad studies in developed countries and the limited attention given to this topic in
developing countries.
3.2 Theoretical perspectives in the study of job ads
Using theories is an indispensable part of the research process in organization sciences and
can prevent logical fallacies and make researches credible and practically applicable
(Ashkanasy, 2016). In job ad studies, theories can help to develop sound explanations and to
generalize findings and can also help readers better comprehend the outcomes of job ad
features. Our findings show that theories were applied in only 11.5% of job ad-related studies.
In those studies in which theories were explicitly applied, researchers used eight theoretical
perspectives to study job ads and their impacts and outcomes: person-environment (P-E) fit
(36%), signaling theory (21%), congruity theory (14%), the AIDA (attract, interest, desire, and
action) theoretical framework (11%), media richness theory (11%), social identity theory
(3.5%), genre theory (3%), and convention theory (0.5%).
Considering that typologies can help to map the landscape of ideas that influence a
particular field, they are crucial to any understanding of a diverse theoretical area
(Allmendinger, 2002) such as job advertising. Based on the findings, the typology of
theoretical perspectives for the study of job ads is presented in Table 1. We believe that this
typology can stimulate more empirical research (Doty and Glick, 1994), allowing us to move
beyond traditional linear or interaction theories to provide a mechanism for incorporating a
holistic principle of inquiry into job ad research or acting as a starting point for developing
other theories (Hung, 1998; Niknazar and Bourgault, 2017) as it revives the missed
opportunities that contribute to the underdevelopment of theories in related fields.
As shown in Table 1, applying different theoretical perspectives depends on different
viewpoints (from whose viewpoint are we going to investigate the job ad field of study) and
different focuses (What/who are we going to study?). For instance, applying the AIDA
framework is logical when we aim to investigate the organizational viewpoint on how they
pursue job ad recipients’ attraction/interest/desire/action. In this case, the primary focus can
be organizational goals (how the AIDA framework serves different organizational purposes),
messages (how to shape a job ad that is able to attract, create interest, increase desire and lead
to action), or target populations (how potential applicants go through the different steps
of AIDA).
According to person-environment fit, the compatibility of people and their work
environments explains the reasons for job seekers’ attraction to different organizations, jobs
or industries (Verwaeren et al., 2017). Signaling theory has many applications in the
occupational realm under study (Bokek-Cohen, 2018). The theory explains how signals or
cues in job ads are interpreted by job seekers (Muruganantham et al., 2020; Story et al., 2016)
and makes job seekers attracted to a job (Wille and Derous, 2017). In signaling theory, indirect
cues and signals play an important role in job seekers’ attraction and further decisions
(Highhouse and Hoffman, 2001, in: Wille and Derous, 2017), especially in the absence of direct
information (Celani and Singh, 2011, in: Verwaeren et al., 2017). Congruity theory highlights
the importance of the fit between the information presented in a message and the information
that already exists. Therefore, as recipients’ knowledge about the information presented in a
message differs, their interpretation about that message also varies. Following the AIDA
framework, the first task of job ads is to attract attention, the second task is to increase the
interest in a job, the third task is to generate desire, and the final task is to encourage action
(Blackman, 2006). If an ad does not succeed in attracting attention (the first step), it does not
matter what the advertisement contains as it will not be noticed (Redman and Mathews,
1992). According to media richness theory, by using richer media for job advertising,
recruiters are able to convey information more effectively. Media richness has been affected

and defined by four factors (Baum and Kabst, 2014): (1) the ability of the media to send
multiple warning signals, (2) enabling the message sender to receive prompt feedback from
the recipients, (3) benefiting from both written and spoken language, and (4) the possibility to
communicate with personalized information. Social identity theory encompasses how
individuals classify themselves into different social categories and how they seek to identify
themselves with those groups and categories. With regard to job advertising, researchers
have shown that job seekers tend to interpret job ads to identify how the organization and its
work environment are similar to them (Baum et al., 2016a, b). Genre theory concerns the
content and style of different types of text and determines their features for the goals they are
expected to serve. Finally, by expanding the view on the way ad recipients interpret signals
about prospective employers, convention theory helps us study the systematic information
processing in mixed-signal situations (Pernkopf et al., 2020).
3.3 Important features of job ads
Based on our review, we found seven important features of job ads that are believed to have
important impacts on (potential) applicants. Considering all seven dimensions expounded on
in the following subsections, we formulated a know-how framework for job advertising
(Table 2).
Synthesizing the literature, we propose that advertising a job/position should begin by
considering the ad’s purpose (defining the “why question”). Subsequently, considering the
target sector (the “where question”) will lead us to find the priority in media usage (the “what
question”), and then previous evidence helps us determine which strategy should be used (the
“how question”) to achieve better outcomes. After determining the job ad’s purposes (“why
question”), we go through the where, what, and how questions as the framework’s main cell
content that are explicated below.
Summarizing the “where question,” there seems to be a gap between recruitment theory
and practice, with a little inconsistency among the results of previous studies. Although
nonprofit sector organizations are generally known as the ideal choice for applicants with
intrinsic-oriented values and altruistic attitudes, in practice, the marketing approaches
adopted by nonprofit organizations focus mainly on extrinsic values or do not give sufficient
attention to values. From this, one can draw some lessons for both researchers and
practitioners. For researchers, it seems necessary to emphasize contextual issues more

preferably using congruity theory to link job ads and sectors. For recruiters, it seems vital to
consider their organizational context and values and the nature of their potential applicants
when forming their job ads.
Regarding answering the “what question” and optimizing ad outcomes, research suggests
that employers need to differentiate between two types of media when designing a job ad and
consider their specific usages and goals they serve (Baum and Kabst, 2014). That is, it seems
that recruiters need to adopt a hybrid and synergistic approach toward job advertising by
utilizing both printed and online ads to gain better results. More concretely, recruiters can
shape the content/style of their online job ads more focused on the micro level of job seekers’
attraction and design their printed job ads to serve a broader purpose of creating a positive
organizational image.
The “how question” features and contingencies and the main findings for job ad features
are thematically discussed in the following subsections.
3.3.1 Online ads versus printed ads. Job ads exist in both print (e.g., newspapers,
magazines, and journals) and online media (e.g., recruiter websites, web-based social
networks, and career webpages) (Ahsan et al., 2013). Currently, reports show that 70% of all
jobs are advertised through online media (Carnevale et al., 2014, in: Kim and Angnakoon,
2016), which can imply the current importance of online ads.
Studies show that printed ads are usually shorter, less detailed, and more costly (Sodhi
and Son, 2010, in: Ahsan et al., 2013) whereas online ads are more detailed (Baum and Kabst,
2014), less costly, and easier to access and update (Kaba, 2017); furthermore, it seems that
online ads can have a stronger impact on applicant attraction as they have larger capacities
according to the media richness theory perspective (Baum and Kabst, 2014).
The literature shows that the proportion of different media usages (online versus printed)
cannot represent their value and superiority since job ads do not merely serve one purpose of
applicant attraction. Printed and online ads at a broader level also have strong impacts on
organizational publicity and images, where evidence shows that printed ads can have a
greater impact on improving publicity and organizational image (Sisodia and Chowdhary,
2012). When discussing the importance of job ad media, however, there is a large
inconsistency in how scholars view printed and online ads. First, some scholars stated that
recent developments in technology cause online media to play a major role in job advertising
(Dineen and Noe, 2009; Oikarinen and S€oderlund, 2016), that recruiters rarely use newspapers
to advertise job openings anymore (Kim and Angnakoon, 2016), and that printed ads are
being replaced by web-based ads (Walker et al., 2008, in: Baum et al., 2016a, b). Second, some
believe that written job ads serve their purpose well (Frijters et al., 2005, in: De Cooman and
Pepermans, 2012) and that other media should just be used as a supplementary tool to printed
media (newspapers) because printed ads help companies shape their image (Sisodia and
Chowdhary, 2012), which cannot be fulfilled in a virtual world (Ramachander, 2008, in:
Sisodia and Chowdhary, 2012).
3.3.2 Content versus style. The content and style of job ads have large influences on job
seekers’ organizational attitudes, applicant attraction, and their decision to apply (Coberet al.,
2003; Walker et al., 2008). The literature shows that job ad content can be composed of a vast
variety of information such as the following: job title, company and job features, candidate
qualifications, working hours/dates, salary and rewards, etc. There is a strong link between
job ad content and potential applicants’ decisions to apply (Jones Willness and Madey, 2014,
in: Uberschaer € et al., 2016; Weiet al., 2016), mainly due to its potential to influence job seekers’
perceptions about jobs, organizations and working conditions. It has been argued that
information more relevant to a vacancy or organization will be perceived as more favorable
(Yuce and Highhouse, 1998, in: Acarlar and Bilgiç, 2013). Researchers also found that
presenting information on salary and benefits leads to receiving more applicants compared to
when job ads lack that information (Kaplan et al., 1991, in: Acarlar and Bilgiç, 2013).
Recruitment

job
advertisement
Job ad style, as both an ad’s aesthetic properties and way of expressing the information,
encompasses many aspects such as the following: size, layout, font, color, design, and the
approach toward using language. All of these aspects can greatly influence job seekers’
perceptions. Findings show that job ad style can play a vital role in supporting job ad content
and increasing its persuasiveness and applicant attraction. For example, evidence shows that
ads can use humor as a cheap and nontraditional tool to form a positive perception about
employer brands (Oikarinen and Saraniemi, 2016), use aesthetic properties to increase
organizational attractiveness (Coberet al., 2003), use proper pictures/photographs to enhance
the effectiveness of imagery appeals (Ostinelli and B€ockenholt, 2017), or use real pictures of
the staff to increase potential applicant attraction (Burt et al., 2010).
Hence, it is important to examine both job ad content and style as two complementary
features that should be used consciously. However, it seems that the influence of job ads’
content and style is dependent on job seekers’ prior work and job search experience
(Walker et al., 2008). One study showed that job ad content has a larger impact on
experienced job seekers’ attitudes while less experienced job seekers would be more
influenced by job ads’ style (Walker et al., 2008). Therefore, one can conclude that due to
the importance of job seekers’ prior experience, recruiters may consider focusing more on
the content of ads for higher level vacancies and specially consider job ads’ style for entrylevel positions.
3.3.3 Specified (detailed) versus nonspecified (undetailed). Specified and nonspecified
information in a job advertisement is among one of the important issues, constituting 5.5% of
the sources in our database. Although research shows that highly specified and detailed job
ads can decrease the quantity of the applicant pool (Belt and Paolillo, 1982; in: Weiet al., 2016),
prior studies have shown that specified job ads have many positive outcomes (Verwaeren
et al., 2017). There is some evidence that shows that specificity can positively influence
perceptions about job appropriateness, ad truthfulness, and attitudes toward organizations
and job advertisements (Feldman et al., 2006; in: Acarlar and Bilgiç, 2013). It is also associated
with more organizational attractiveness and higher informativeness of the ads (Lee et al.,
2011). Furthermore, it has been argued that specificity presents organizations’ sincerity and
trustworthiness and helps potential applicants reduce their search costs and better
understand their person-organizational fit (Wei et al., 2016). In addition, researchers believe
that specified and detailed job ads can counteract negative publicity surrounding
organizations (Lee et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013).
Hence, one can conclude that neglecting message specificity in job ads can increase the
number of unqualified applicants and subsequently increase recruitment and selection costs.
Therefore, using specified ads seems to generally be a good approach to job advertising.
However, employers might utilize nonspecified job ads or specify fewer job requirements
when they need their vacancies filled immediately since such ads can decrease the selfscreening impact on job seekers’ intention to apply and might help the vacancy to be filled
earlier by increasing the number of applicants.
3.3.4 Discriminatory versus nondiscriminatory language. The broad problem of global
inequality can be investigated from different aspects. Discrimination in employment is one of
the influential factors (Daspro, 2009); although its driving factors are still not properly
recognized, studies have addressed its main roots in cultural and legal system contingencies
(Gao, 2008). Discriminatory language in a job ad can be used both directly, by emphasizing a
preference for different kinds of candidates, and indirectly, by setting some criteria to exclude
those candidates (Sergeant and Lewis, 2006; Taylor and Emir, 2006; in: Woodhams et al.,
2009). Discrimination in job ads can occur based on age, gender, physical appearance, marital
status (Daspro, 2009), race and ethnicity (Williamson et al., 2008), or even religion (Leong et al.,
2004). Despite equality and nondiscriminatory rules for job advertising in many countries,
there is still evidence showing discrimination in organizations’ job ads. Among all types of
IJOTB
discrimination in job ads, gender (in 86% of related studies) and race-related discrimination
(14%) have received the most attention by scholars.
Regarding gender, executive or director positions largely consist of men and not women or
gender-diverse groups (Nater and Sczesny, 2016). High position job ads often emphasize
masculine traits, which might create an image of women as less legitimate top managers than
men (Askehave and Zethsen, 2014). These ads may consequently deprive organizations of
benefiting from female talent in higher positions (Askehave and Zethsen, 2014). Nevertheless,
evidence shows that using gender-neutral language in ads is easy and not costly (Horvath
and Sczesny, 2016). One of the simplest ways to motivate women to apply for higher-level jobs
is to make them linguistically visible, such as by using word pairs (he/she) when using
pronouns, because it reduces women’s perception of a lack of fit with high-level jobs or
leadership positions (Horvath and Sczesny, 2016).
Regarding race, it has been stated that racially diverse employees can bring sustainable
competitive advantages for organizations (Cox and Blake, 1991; Thomas, 2004, in: Haggard
and Haggard, 2017; Williamson et al., 2008). An important step in creating a diverse
workforce is to attract a diverse set of job seekers using organization job ads (Barber, 1998, in:
Williamson et al., 2008). One study found that messages of diversity can attract job seekers to
organizations, and the prior discrimination experiences of these individuals can moderate
this relation (Williamson et al., 2008). It has also been found that in less regulated
environments, organizations might tend to use discriminatory job ads (Leong et al., 2004);
therefore, not only recruiters but also policy makers can play important roles in deterring
discrimination in job ads. Overall, lessons of previous studies suggest that recruiters should
avoid discriminatory job ads since they are not based on free market operations, might cause
some inefficiency in exploiting human resources, and might prevent individuals from
competing fairly and freely (Woodhams et al., 2009).
3.3.5 Minority-focused versus majority-focused. The benefit of a diversified workforce is
vital for organizations, especially for multinational corporations (MNCs) or those engaging in
international trade. Findings show that utilizing messages of diversity, as a simple and cheap
method, plays an important role in attracting minorities while keeping majorities interested in
applying for jobs. Hiring employees with different personal and demographic features can help
organizations better understand the marketplace (Smedley et al., 2004; in: Ng et al., 2016) and
find more innovative ways to solve daily work problems (Cox, 2001; in: Ng et al., 2016). To form
such a workforce, organizations need to be able to attract both minority and majority applicants
(Allen et al., 2007; Barber, 1998, in: Ng et al., 2016). One of the most effective and economical
ways to both attract minorities and keep majorities interested is to use messages of diversity in
organizations’ job ads. How can this be done? There are many variables that can determine the
effectiveness of messages of diversity that should be considered by recruiters, such as the
regulatory focus of job applicants (ego-focused vs. other-focused) (Han and Ling, 2016), level of
the jobs (Ng et al., 2016), a firm’s country of origin (Baum et al., 2016a, b), racial tolerance (Brown
et al., 2006; in: Baum et al., 2016a, b), and featuring minority representatives (Avery et al., 2004).
3.3.6 Applicant pool quantity versus applicant pool quality. There is a controversial debate
around the advantages of applicant pool quality over quantity in the job ad literature.
Although increasing the quantity of applicant pools allows organizations to increase the
number of qualified applicants (Liu et al., 2016), focusing on applicant pool quality also has
many important advantages, such as increasing the efficiency of applicant processing,
decreasing legal risks by minimizing rejected applicants, decreasing selection costs (Cappelli,
2001; Dineen and Noe, 2009, in: Dineen and Williamson, 2012), reducing potential negative
reactions of applicants (Chapman and Webster, 2003; in: Dineen and Noe, 2009), and saving
applicants’ and employers’ time and effort (Dineen and Noe, 2009). Overall, although most
studies have focused on applicant attraction to increase the applicant pool quantity, there are
many reasons that justify the importance of applicant pool quality. Therefore, recruiters need
Recruitment
with effective
job
advertisement
to follow an approach that enables them to both have a sufficient number and quality of
applicants.
Our findings show that research often focused on applicant pool quantity rather than
emphasizing applicant pool quality. Research suggests that to increase the quantity of
applicant pools, organizations can use nonspecified job ads; in addition, by applying specified
job ads, they can aim to increase the quality of their applicant pools (Mason and Belt, 1986).
Paying attention to the aesthetic properties of job ads (Jones et al., 2006; Kaplan et al., 1991)
and presenting sufficient information about salary and company benefits can also increase
applicant pool quantity (Kaplan et al., 1991). It has also been shown that favorable
organizational reputation (Dineen and Williamson, 2012) and advertising organizational
image (Collins and Han, 2004; in: Lee et al., 2013) can increase both applicant pool quantity and
quality.
3.3.7 Nonprofit sector versus for-profit sector. We found that the data were collected in the
nonprofit sector for 11% of the articles, in the for-profit sector for 15% of the articles, and in
both sectors for 32% of the articles; furthermore, 42% of the articles did not provide
information about the sector in which the data were collected. Only approximately 2% of
those studies explicitly considered sector-specific and contextual features in their research
designs, which is important because sector-specific characteristics have diverse and
influential implications for multiple stakeholders (e.g., citizens, interest groups, social
partners and the media) (Knies et al., 2015).
On the employer side, the studies that did explicitly consider sector-specific features
show first that nonprofit sector organizations use less eye-catching and prestigious job
ads, which can be attributed to financial restrictions; they also emphasize altruistic and
extrinsic values (e.g., insurance and fringe benefits) in their job ads while for-profit sector
organizations emphasize intrinsic and prestige values (De Cooman and Pepermans, 2012).
Furthermore, the studies showed that many nonprofit organizations adapt market
language in which they neglect to pay sufficient attention to “values” in general (Green
and Dalton, 2007; Redman and Mathews, 1997). As stated by Green and Dalton (2007), it is
important to note that although the managerialist approach (the use of market language)
in nonprofit sector organizations might have some short-term benefits, in the long term,
the whole sector and related community might be hurt because of the many differences
with the profit sector.
On the employee side, compared to their peers in the for-profit sector, evidence shows
that employees in the nonprofit sector pay more attention to intrinsic values (De Cooman
and Pepermans, 2012), the content of jobs (Frank and Lewis, 2004; in: De Cooman and
Pepermans, 2012), learning and creative opportunities and challenging tasks (Lyons et al.,
2006; in: De Cooman and Pepermans, 2012); however, profit sector applicants seek career
advancement (Frank and Lewis, 2004; in: De Cooman and Pepermans, 2012),
opportunities for promotion (Devaro and Brookshire, 2007; Saunders, 2004; in:
De Cooman and Pepermans, 2012), and gaining influence (De Cooman et al., n.d. in:
De Cooman and Pepermans, 2012). Moreover, in general, research shows that employees
find it more inherently satisfying to work in nonprofit sector organizations, and the lower
remuneration in that sector might be compensated by the intrinsic benefits employees
might attain by working there (Mirvis, 1992, in: De Cooman and Pepermans, 2012).
Conversely, it is assumed that the profit sector receives more applicants who prioritize
their wages since they believe they can earn more in profit sector organizations vis-a-vis
equal jobs in the nonprofit sector (Lewis and Frank, 2002; in: De Cooman and Pepermans,
2012). The previous general assumption is empirically supported in the profit sector for
employees who also value the prestigious aspects of work (Lyons et al., 2006; in:
De Cooman and Pepermans, 2012).

4. Discussion
Job ads have recently come under the spotlight more than ever, and there is a fair amount of
literature in this field that helps us to obtain some knowledge about this medium and its
features. Taking stock of the existing literature, in this article, we synthesize the literature
and present a theoretical tool that is useful for understanding and studying job ad features,
and we also distill seven main features of job ads with considerable impacts on (potential)
candidates. Although we currently still know too little to draw solid cause and effect
conclusions regarding how to achieve efficiency in recruitment by applying effective job
advertisements, our research provides a novel and promising theoretical typology that can
assist the next research steps to move the field forward. Furthermore, a know-how
framework for job advertising is also provided, the suggestions of which can give
practitioners a credible framework for shaping job ads and lower the risk of expectable
destructive outcomes of trial and error approaches in job advertising. However, as there are
many qualitative research and cross-sectional studies in this field of study, it is difficult to
draw causal inferences, and we need more experimental research designs to generalize causal
inferences (Shadish et al., 2002).
Before presenting our research agenda, we first acknowledge that our focus on
management and organizational research journals may have led to the omission of some
relevant articles. However, our systematic approach benefits from a rigorous procedure, as
explained in the Methods section, which decreased the probability of missing important
information that could radically have altered the results of our study. Next, although the
reviewed studies were conducted in different countries and in different languages, only
articles written in English were included in our review because of understanding, which can
result in publication bias. We are not aware of any findings in non-English articles that
challenge or alter our findings. Some additional knowledge might be neglected, and our
study’s suggestions and proposed research agenda should be interpreted with that limitation
in mind.
5. Future research directions
Based on our findings, we have found several research streams as an agenda for future
studies. First, approximately 88.5% of the identified studies did not adopt any theoretical
perspective. As the importance and necessity of theoretical tools in related studies discussed,
we encourage efforts to apply the identified theoretical typology as a starting point for
developing a unique grand theory for job advertising and adapt a multitheoretical approach
toward the study of job ads.
Second, studies in the area of the initial stages of recruitment and job advertising are often
focused on job seekers’ attraction to maximize the size of applicant pool rather than creating a
smaller high-quality pool of applicants (Dineen and Noe, 2009). Recruitment is an expensive
organizational function and takes substantial time, money and effort to screen and select
suited staff among many individuals. Therefore, studying the optimal point between the
applicant pool quality and quantity in different organizational contexts with different goals
and sizes and for different positions (concerning hierarchy and needed skills) is suggested.
Third, similar to findings in other literature reviews in public administration (Voorn et al.,
2017), our findings show that a large proportion of studies on job ads do not refer to
organizational context and sector, which can neglect some important issues from the
stakeholder theory perspective, as discussed before. Furthermore, although we sought to
distinguish between job ads in the nonprofit and profit sectors, addressing the distinction
between public/private and service/manufacturing and other types of context-related issues
has been neglected in previous studies. Thus, the need for more context-related studies in the
field of job ad studies is clear.

job
advertisement
Fourth, although different types of discrimination in job ads and gender-related topics
have received attention from researchers, none of our coded articles considered age issues
(old vs. young) related to job advertising. That is interesting because some clues in a book
show that females are the main target of age discrimination in the West (Gregory, 2003) as
their attractiveness might decrease as they age (Marlowe et al., 1996). Moreover, despite the
existing important debate on the recruitment of transgenders and nondiscriminatory
regulations, scholars in the study of job ads have neglected this topic so far. Therefore, age
discrimination in job ads and transgender issues can be two important streams for future
studies on job ads.
Fifth, our study extends Rafaeli and Oliver’s (1998) categorization of different levels of
job ad analysis. In their study, they present a configurational analysis of job ads to build a
framework that maps the complexity of ads, identifies different layers of their audiences
and presents a configurational lens to enhance our understanding of job ads. They
proposed five levels of analysis for job ads: individual, occupational, organizational,
industry, and society. Our study extends their analytical hierarchy by discovering that
there is research on job ads considering differences in national contexts and cultures,
comparing the differences of job ad features in international settings and conducting
some cross-cultural comparisons. However, as stated by researchers, there is a lack of
research on differences in recruiting practices across cultures in different countries,
particularly in regard to job ads (Ma and Allen, 2009; in: Han and Ling, 2016). Hence, there
is a need for more research on those broader macrolevels to develop some insights on
international ads in different national contexts. Furthermore, there is a lack of sufficient
job ad-related studies in developing countries. Due to the great cultural differences that
can influence individuals’ fit perception and social identification, the need for future
studies on job advertisements in developing countries with a focus on their distinct
contexts and cultures seems to be necessary.
Finally, there is still a limited understanding of the concrete effects of singular and
multiple job ad features, as presented in Table 2, on advertising outcomes with respect to
different stakeholders. As we now have a typology of the theoretical perspectives for the
study of job ads and a framework of job ad know-how, we believe that now is the best time to
conduct metastudies that aim to obtain more concrete information on the effects of multiple
job ad features and the roles of different mediators and moderators in addressing different job
ad outcomes.
